            <p>Food blogging is a feature of food journalism interlinking a gourmet interest in food, blog writing, and
                food photography. Food blogs are generally written by food enthusiasts often referred to as a “foodies”

            <p>A food is something that provides nutrients. Nutrients are substances that provide: energy for activity,
                growth, and all functions of the body such as breathing, digesting food, and keeping warm; materials for
                the growth and repair of the body, and for keeping the immune system healthy.</p>

                <h2>My Recipes</h2>
                <p>The measured ingredients in a recipe not only produce consistent food but control your food cost and
                    profit. Recipes reduce waste because a cook is prepping exactly what is needed to produce the menu
                    items. Recipes provide portion control which is a major factor in food cost control and profit.</p>
